# Neural Network for MPox Diagnosis
An artificial neural network that makes recommendations for whether someone should get tested for MPox. The model is trained on data from 25,000 patients exhibiting diverse symptoms of MPox. The network consists of four layers, with 9 nodes in the input layer, 7 nodes in the hidden layers, and one output layer node. The accuracy rate of the model on validation data is 0.68. The model is deployed on the following website: https://david0726.pythonanywhere.com/recommenderApp
